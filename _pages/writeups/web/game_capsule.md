##### Difficulty: <b>Easy</b> 

##### Description:
A popular game-selling app is secretly offering a blacklisted, highly coveted game hidden from public view. Your mission is to hack into the appâ€™s backend, bypass its security, and uncover the hidden game to add it to your collection. Can you outsmart the system and get the forbidden game in your hands?

##### Challenge: 
This was a fairly easy web challenge that required about 2 minutes of my time. The NodeJS application uses JWT to assign/define user roles. It renders the page differently depending on the username inside the JWT. So, I was able to forge a JWT for any user, in this case the "admin" user, which the application uses to determine whether the flag should read from /flag.txt and rendered onto the index.html page.

##### Vulnerable Code:
Inside the AuthMiddleWare file there are two functions, the setcookie and the getcookie function. The getcookie function checks if the incoming request has a cookie, if not the setcookie function generates one with a randomly generated username, such as "guest_ewiufhu4h98hf". It then signs the cookie. 
###### AuthMiddleWare.js file:

The routes file gets the cookie from the AuthMiddleWare and checks the value of the "username", if it is equal to admin it reads the flag from /flag.txt and renders it on the index.html page, if the value is anything else, it just loads the index.html page without the flag.

##### Solution:
After landing on the application, we notice there isn't much in terms of functionality. Just a static page. We can click through the games. That's about it. So, with that, one of the first things I checked, was the esistence of a cookie using the developer tools. An sure enough there was a JWT sitting in storage.

I copied the JWT and pasted it into JWT.io to analyze it. After seeing that the application uses the JWT to determine the "username", I tried changing mine from guest_088u98u3498u89 to "admin" to see if the application would render the home page differently.

After copying the newly forged JWT, I pasted it into the storage and refreshed the page:
